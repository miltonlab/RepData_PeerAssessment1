## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
df <- read.table(unzip('activity.zip','activity.csv'), sep=',', header=T)
summary(df)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
byDay <- ddply(df, ~date, summarise, totalSteps=sum(steps))
clean <- byDay[complete.cases(byDay),]
#head(byDay)
ggplot(clean, aes(x=as.Date(date))) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5,alpha=.5,colour="black", position="identity") + scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format())

```  

The mean totalSteps by day is **`r mean(clean$totalSteps)`**  
The median totalSteps by day is **`r median(clean$totalSteps)`**  

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
